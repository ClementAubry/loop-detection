LOOP DETECTION OF MOBILE ROBOTS USING INTERVAL ANALYSIS

This paper proposes an original set-membership approach
for loop detection of mobile robots. To detect loops, the new concepts
of t-plane (which is a two dimensional space with time coordinates) is
introduced. Interval of functions (or tubes) are then used to represent
uncertain trajectories and tests are provided in order to elimate parts
of the t-plane that do not correspond to any loop. Some examples are
proposed in order to illustrate the principle and the efÔ¨Åciency of the
approach.
